Last weekend I've received a strange sms:

> Congratulation! Your cell number has just won 300,000 pounds in the Ongoing UK COCACOLA 2010 PROMO. Email: cocacolauklive@live.co.uk or call+447045730922

This is obviously a scam. Check out the Windows Live e-mail-address or the common telephone number and the fact I've won out of the blue 300.000 pounds.

But I really was curious about how the scammers would try to get my money. So I called the number:

The man on the other side for sure wasn't from Great Britain, he sounded more like an Indian. He told me to send my personal details like name and address to the e-mail-address found in the sms.

I didn't go further but I'm still kinda wondering what the next steps would be. Maybe setting up a fake e-mail and use some fake credentials and wait for their response, but that would be to much work.

After searching the web, there a lots of similar Coca Cola scams with e-mail. Some even suggest it's often not really to steal your money but only your personal details used for fake identities.

Last thing I did was filling in a report to the internet fraud crime unit in Belgium. They've setup a site called [e-cops](https://www.ecops.be/) especially for reporting such scams.
